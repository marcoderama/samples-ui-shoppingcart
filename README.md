### Frontend Service

The frontend service is a front end web application written in typescript.  It is backed by a `stateless` service that will serve the compiled javacript, html and images.

This service makes `grpc-web` calls directly to the other services to get the data that it needs.  In order to do this we need to compile the proto definitions from the other services as well as generate the grpc-web clients.  This is all done with a shell script `protogen.sh`.  Let's first run the protogen script, then compile the service definition and finally compile our typescript.

```
cd frontend
```

#### Installing development dependencies (optional)

Although this is not required for building and deploying the service, you might want to set up development environment
```
nvm install
nvm use
npm install
```
This will install your dependencies, including cloudstate javascript client library.

Now you can build the project
```
npm run build
```
The build script will compile the typescript and javascript into a webpack bundle.js file. This contains the code for your web front end.

#### Building a container image

Build a docker image with the right registry and tag

NOTE: you can get a free public docker registry by signing up at [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/)

```
docker build . -t <my-registry>/frontend:latest
```

Push the docker image to the registry

```
docker push <my-registry>/frontend:latest
```

Now the image is in the registry you can deploy it either to your own Cloudstate installation or to Lightbend's Cloudstate

#### Deployment instructions

This service is supposed to be used as a part of one of the Shopping Cart samples:

* https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-js-shoppingcart
* https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-java-shoppingcart

Please follow the instructions in one of these repositories to deploy this service.
**Note:** If you have built your own Docker image, be sure to replace the location of that image with the repository you pushed it to.

#### Local testing

In order to run the shopping cart client locally you need to do the following:

1. Bring up the backend services (the cart, shopping and inventory services) using a convenient docker-compose configuration...

`docker-compose -f backend.yml up -d`

You can shut this down with `docker-compose -f backend.yml down` and follow the logs with `docker-compose -f backend.yml logs -f`.

Each service includes three parts; the service itself, an akka sidecar for it to connect with and a grpc-web proxy so that we can interact with the services directly from a web browser (which do not support grpc).

2. The frontend is served via a node.js server which listens on port 8080, but that is not enough to operate with Cloudstate, you also need an akka sidecar that is able to connect with it. In order to do that bring one up with the following docker command:

`docker run -it --rm --name cloudstate-frontend -p 9003:9000 --env USER_FUNCTION_HOST=host.docker.internal cloudstateio/cloudstate-proxy-dev-mode:latest`

Note that this sidecar exposes its 9000 port to 9003 on the local network, and you'll be able to browse the shopping service using the url http://localhost:9003/pages/index.html

It also sets the USER_FUNCTION_HOST environment variable (the host that the sidecar will try to connect to find the user service) to `host.docker.internal` which in Docker is a hostname mapped to your local network, which is the network we will run the frontend on.

3. Run the frontend.

In order to run the frontend locally we need to configure it correctly to attach the services on their individual ports. In a full Cloudstate deployment all the services would be accessed by the web frontend over the same host and port (the same one you access the web page on), but in local testing they are all different. To handle this you can set the host and port for each service individually in a way that matches up to the config in `backend.yml`. You need to build a special version of the server that has these settings.

```
npm run build:local_dev
npm start
```

Now you should be able to use the full application and the services it depends on without needing Kubernetes or an ingress setup like Istio.

Alternatively, you can also run the frontend using docker to test locally. You can do so by building a development Docker image instead.

Create a file called `.env` in the root folder of your project with the contents...

`DOCKER_PUBLISH_TO=<your repo here>`

```
DOCKER_PUBLISH_TO=<your repo here>` npm run dockerdevbuild
docker-compose -f frontend.yml up -d
```
